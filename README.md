## PS Category
Software

## Team ID
1732

## Team Name
Hexa-Hack

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a visualization tool that enhances the quality of shadowed lunar regions captured by the OHRC (Optical High Resolution Camera) on Chandrayaan-2. The tool will help in:
* **Identifying craters and uneven surfaces** in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs).
* **Detecting potential obstacles** for safer lunar rover landing procedures.
* **Creating a 3D virtual simulation** using OHRC images, facilitating:
  + **Prediction of hidden obstacles**
  + **Understanding lunar surface topology**
  + **Improved navigation and mission planning**

## Technology Stack
* **Backend:** Unity 3D, VR Gen AI, Docker, JSON, Python (CV2, jss files), Robo-flow databases
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GSAP, three.js, shery.js, locomotive, Adobe Photoshop, Figma, Blender

## Methodology
* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **3D Visualizations:** Three.js and GSAP
* **3D Model Design:** Blender
* **Simulation:** Unity 3D and VR Gen AI
* **Image Processing:** Python CV2
* **Data Management:** Robo-flow, Docker, and JSON

## Benefits
* **Improved Navigation and Obstacle Avoidance:** Leading to safer and more successful lunar missions.
* **Scientific Discoveries:** Assisting in uncovering hidden features and enhancing understanding of the Moon's history, composition, and evolution.
* **Cost-Effective and Portable:** Runs on a virtual canvas and has low-end app versions for Android, iOS, and desktops.
* **Fast and Efficient:** Generates heatmaps and topography within 3 seconds for a single data set.
* **Easy Integration:** Can be integrated with existing ISRO frameworks.

## Challenges and Solutions
* **Unavailability of Real-Time Data:** 
  + System can generate estimates and predict terrain conditions using previously collected data.
  + Simulate environment with non-real-time data and enhance it with predictions.
* **Low-Quality Images:** 
  + Combine multiple images using image fusion techniques to reconstruct a higher-quality composite image.

## Impacts
* **ISRO:** Better mission planning, optimal landing site selection, and obstacle prediction.
* **Scientists:** Deeper insights into lunar geology and surface processes.
* **Students:** Practical experience in terrain analysis, mission planning, and image enhancement.

## Conclusion
This project will be a valuable tool for ISRO, researchers, and students in the field of lunar exploration.
